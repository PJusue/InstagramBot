# Project overview
This is a telegram bot programed in python which can upload a photo to instagram and add it the caption.
It uses the InstagramAPI of https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python.

All the bot to instagram communication has been made using this API.

This bot uses the telegram username and the chat id of the user to store in a MySQL database the information about the instagram user.

The functions for a PKI system to cypher the passwords are programed but not implemented.
